# Student Performance EDA

This project explores student performance in math, reading, and writing using demographic and contextual features.

## Key Findings
- Students who completed test preparation consistently scored higher across all groups.
- Higher parental education levels are associated with higher baseline performance.
- While average scores differ across race/ethnicity groups, score distributions overlap substantially, suggesting contextual factors play a larger role than race alone.

## Next Steps
- Feature selection
- Preprocessing
- Baseline modeling
